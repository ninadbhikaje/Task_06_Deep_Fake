# AI-Generated Interview Script (Syracuse 2024 Men’s Lacrosse)

HOST: Quick take—how would you grade Syracuse’s 2024 season?
ANALYST: Syracuse went 12–6 with a positive goal differential of +67. The season showed growth in both offense and possession.

HOST: Who powered the offense?
ANALYST: Joey Spallina led in points, Owen Hiltz led in goals, and Christian Mulé added depth. The attack unit was consistent across the season.

HOST: What kept them from two more wins?
ANALYST: Marginal gains in defense and clears. Syracuse cleared at .871, while opponents were closer to .893. That difference cost possessions in tight games.

HOST: Should next season focus on offense or defense?
ANALYST: Defense and possession. Syracuse already scored plenty; the bigger gain is one more stop or one more clear.

HOST: Name a player who could be a game-changer.
ANALYST: Faceoff specialist Mason Kohn. His ground balls and draws control possessions. If he improves efficiency, Syracuse starts with more offensive chances.
